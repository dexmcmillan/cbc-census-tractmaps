# Census boundary files for Datawrapper
This repository contains GeoJSON files for use in Datawrapper. All boundaries based on 2021 StatsCan Census Data.

Files are all contained within the [data > cities](https://github.com/dexmcmillan/cbc-census-tractmaps/tree/main/data/cities) folder.

The Jupyter notebook in this repository shows how I broke the data apart.

Naming convention for GeoJSON files follows: PROVINCE-TYPE-NAME.geojson, where type is either CA (Census Agglomeration) or CMA (Census Metropolitan Area).
